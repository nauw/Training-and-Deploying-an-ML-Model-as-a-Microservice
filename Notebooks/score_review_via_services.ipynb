      "for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \n",
      "to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \n",
      "the book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \n",
      "in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . \n",
      "if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . \n",
      "getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \n",
      "the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . \n",
      "it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \n",
      "when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \n",
      "abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \n",
      "upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . \n",
      "i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \n",
      "in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \n",
      "it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \n",
      "and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \n",
      "don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . \n",
      "now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \n",
      "the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \n",
      "oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \n",
      "even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \n",
      "ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \n",
      "i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . \n",

      "what happened ? \n",
      "how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? \n",
      "even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . \n",
      "broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . \n",
      "witherspoon is a revelation . \n",
      "it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . \n",

      "he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \n",
      "unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \n",

      "he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . \n",
      "he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . \n",

      "even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \n",
      "although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \n",
      "the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \n",

      "dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \n",
      "however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \n",
      "bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \n",
      "he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . \n",

      "at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \n",
      "as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \n",
      "the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \n",
      "lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \n",
      "his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \n",
      "the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \n",
      "this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \n",

      "i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . \n",
      "as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . \n",
      "it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . \n",
      "norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . \n",
      "he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . \n",
      "the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . \n",
      "we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . \n",
      "in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . \n",
      "much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . \n",
      "when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . \n",
      "what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . \n",
      "it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . \n",
      "because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \n",
      "i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . \n",
      "the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \n",
      "it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \n",
      "of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \n",
      "it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \n",
      "in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \n",
      "even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \n",
      "what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \n",
      "the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . \n",
      "visually , the film is very powerful . \n",
      "kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \n",
      "but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \n",
      "although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \n",
      "for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \n",
      "it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \n",
      "perhaps this last scene was the problem . \n",
      "it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \n",

      "and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . \n",

      "alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . \n",
      "as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . \n",
      "walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . \n",
      "ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . \n",

      "she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . \n",
      "and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance . \n",
      "thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . \n",

      "walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . \n",
      "when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , \" money versus values . \" \n",
      "ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises . \n",
      "sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . \n",
      "it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . \n",
      "lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . \n",
      "lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . \n",
      "and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . \n",
      "lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . \n",
      "i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed . \n",
      "the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . \n",
      "joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) . \n",
      "alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . \n",
      "the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . \n",
      "as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . \n",
      "and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . \n",

      "the annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed \" arnie the dinosaur \" ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . \n",

      "that's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \n",
      "they haven't spoken in years , and wouldn't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren't for kaisa's mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \n",

      "by the time they reach the hospital , it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \n",

      "it's worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter's captivating signs & wonders . \n",

      "nossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \n",
      "if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it's willing to stretch beyond what we've come to expect from traditional drama . \n",

      "when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \n",

      "i will give the movie this much , and that is that its main reason for being ( its \" raison-d'etre \" , as the french would say ) , its fight sequences , do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film . \n",
